HEADER LOGO (your image)
------------------------
Place your bank logo image here so it appears in the blue header bar:

  header-logo.png

Use a circular or square logo (e.g. the R/B "RURAL BANK OF PAETE / SINCE 1965" logo).
Recommended: PNG with transparent background, at least 112x112 px so it stays sharp.
If the file is missing, a light circular placeholder is shown.


HERO ILLUSTRATION (your image)
-------------------------------
Place your hero section illustration image here:

  hero-illustration.png

This is the illustration shown on the right side of the hero section (e.g. person with money bag and bank card).
Recommended: PNG with transparent background, around 400-500px height for best quality.
If the file is missing, the illustration area will be empty.


Hero background image
---------------------
Place your hero section background image here with this exact filename:

  landing page bg section 1.JPG

The hero section uses:  assets/landing page bg section 1.JPG

If the file is missing, the hero will show a solid blue fallback color.
